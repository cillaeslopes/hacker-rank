# README

This project contais some [Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges) exercises done by me ([Pri Lopes](cillaeslopes@gmail.com)).

That's what you need to know:
- The exercises were developed in Python 2
- The files contain some tests that are the same initial tests you can see in the exercise in Hacker Rank
- Since I've done the exercises with some tests, there are some unnecessary classes and methods for the exercise, so if you are trying to test the code by just copying and paste it won't work. You need to copy only the essential methods and it is possible that you need to make some changes in it's callings 

If you want to talk to me [send me an email](cillaeslopes@gmail.com)
